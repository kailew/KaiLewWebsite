              <h2>Though the Eyes of Creativity</h2>
              <p>
                Through the Eyes of Creativity starts with a thirteen photo
                journey through Los Angeles. My model goes by the name Husse who
                has become a singer and songwriter over the past years. We start
                by traveling all throughout Los Angeles, from rooftops to
                underground train stations. I chose singer and songwriter Husse
                as he has introduced me to many thought-provoking ideas,
                changing my mind for the better. In return, I would like to
                tribute this into a creative art project. My goal is to provoke
                passion from this artist as he has gone “all in” on his journey
                through music. The photos will be taken at places Husse feels
                most creative. Then how he deals with what is given in each
                environment. I want to show and tell a story to people about how
                one’s mind can show just how much a person feels.
